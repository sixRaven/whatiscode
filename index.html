        There’s a website dedicated to language benchmarks, to measuring how fast certain languages run compared with others, and it includes this preface to stave off riots: “These are not the only compilers and interpreters. These are not the only programs that could be written. These are not the only tasks that could be solved. These are just 10 tiny examples.”<a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light1').style.display='block';">16</a>

            Writing this article was a nightmare because I know that no matter how many people review it, I’ll have missed something, some thread that a reader can pull and say, “He missed the essence of the subject.” I know you’re out there, ashamed to have me as an advocate. I accept that. I know that what I describe as “compilation” is but a tiny strand of that subject; I know that the ways I characterize programming languages are reductive. This was supposed to be a brief article, and it became a brief book. So my apologies for anything that absolutely should have been here, but isn’t. They gave me only one magazine.

        It sometimes appears that everyone in coding has a beef. You can feel it coming off the Web pages. There are a lot of defensive postscripts added in response to outrage. “People have reacted strongly to this post,” they’ll read. “I did not mean to imply that Java sucks.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Languages have agendas. People glom onto them. Blunt talk is seen as a good quality in a developer, a sign of an “engineering mindset”—spit out every opinion as quickly as possible, the sooner to reach a technical consensus. Expect to be told you’re wrong; expect to tell other people they’re wrong. (Masculine anger, bluntly expressed, is part of the industry.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Coding is a culture of blurters. This can yield fast decisions, but it penalizes people who need to quietly compose their thoughts, rewarding fast-twitch thinkers who harrumph efficiently. Programmer job interviews, which often include abstract and meaningless questions that must be answered immediately on a whiteboard, typify this culture. Regular meetings can become sniping matches about things that don’t matter. The shorthand term for that is “bikeshedding.” (Who cares what color the bike shed is painted? Well …)
    </p>
    <p>
        Code culture is very, very broad, but the geographic and cultural core is the Silicon Valley engine of progress. The Valley mythologizes young geniuses with vast sums. To its credit, this culture works; to its shame, it doesn’t work for everyone.

        At any moment some new thing could catch fire and disrupt the tribal ebb and flow. Instagram was written in Python and sold for $700 million, so Python had a moment of glory. The next mind-blowing app could show up, written in some new language—and start everyone taking that more seriously. Within 18 months your skills could be, if not quite valueless, suspect.
    </p>
    <p>
        I was in a meeting once where someone said, “How long will it take to fix that?” One person, who’d been at the company for years, said, “Three months.” A new person, who’d just come from a world of rapidly provisioned cloud microservices, said, “Three minutes.” They were both correct. That’s how change enters into this world. Slowly at first, then on the front page of Hacker News.

        Programmers carve out a sliver of cognitive territory for themselves and go to conferences, and yet they know their position is vulnerable. They get defensive when they hear someone suggest that Python is better than Ruby, because [insert 500-comment message thread here]. Is the next great wave swelling somewhere, and will it wash away Java when it comes? Will Go conquer Python? Do I need to learn JavaScript to remain profitable? Programmers are often angry because they’re often scared. We are, most of us, stumbling around with only a few candles to guide the way. We can’t always see the whole system, so we need to puzzle it out, bit by bit, in the dark.

        4.1 The Legend of the 10x Programmer
    </h2>
    <p>
        Programming has twin cults of genius and youth. One of the ways Google acquired its reputation was by hiring fresh-faced whizzes. Ph.D.s from Stanford, Cal Tech, MIT, and Carnegie Mellon were table stakes. The true programmer began to code in utero and has an IQ of at least 10,000.
    </p>
    <p>
        There’s even the legend of the 10x programmer, an individual who is just that much more productive than the proletariat. There is evidence that some programmers are much more productive than their equally experienced peers; but other studies have found this to be engineering folklore. Ten is an order of magnitude in a discipline that uses orders of magnitude to estimate things. Ten is an attractive and thus suspicious number.
    </p>
    <p>
        That said, the industry undeniably attracts brilliant thinkers. I’ve met a few. You can tell they’re brilliant because their solutions make you laugh and go, “Oh, I would never have thought of that.” The sparks in their brains jump some pretty wide gaps. They know more than the manuals. Some people put the time in; some people can’t help but be obsessed; and some people are just so damn smart that it’s a revelation to be around them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Dream of 10x programmers if you will. But I wouldn’t hold out hope that one will come to work for you. You can’t hire them for the same reasons you can’t coach the Chicago Bulls and you aren’t often called upon to date supermodels of your preferred gender. They’re not interviewing at your crappy company for your crappy job. They’re not going to come and rescue your website; they’re not going to make you an app that puts mustaches on photos; they’re not going to listen to you when you offer them the chance to build the next Facebook, because, if they exist, they are busy building the real Facebook. Sometimes they’re thinking about higher mathematics, or how to help a self-driving car manage the ethical choice between running over a squirrel and driving off a cliff. Or they’re riding their bikes, or getting really into pottery. It’s hard to have a better life than a great programmer, as long as they’re unencumbered by physical or mental illness.
    </p>
    <p>
        Programming is a task that rewards intense focus and can be done with a small group or even in isolation. It’s come to have an association with Asperger’s syndrome; many programmers will say they “are somewhere on the spectrum,” though these self-diagnoses can be a little self-serving—being obsessive is seen as a good thing by many coders. And some jobs programs have successfully placed people on the autism spectrum in programming careers. But the idea that people with Asperger’s make good programmers is as suspect as the idea that women aren’t naturally inclined to coding; both assumptions, to use a term beloved of the Internet, are problematic, and deeply reductive. Tread lightly: All kinds of people can be programmers. And autistic people can have all kinds of careers.
    </p>
    <p>
        If 10x programmers exist, they require 10x managers at 10x companies. There’s no shame in not being 10x yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a truly gifted programmer, writing code is a side effect of thought. Their skill isn’t in syntax; it’s how they perceive time and computation. They can see the consequences of their actions more quickly than the next programmer; they spend less time in the dark. Their code still has bugs, it still needs to be optimized—they’re not without flaws. But for every candle we own, they have three or four flashlights and a map.

        As a class, programmers are easily bored, love novelty, and are obsessed with various forms of productivity enhancement. God help you if you’re ever caught in the middle of a conversation about nutrition; standing desks; the best keyboards; the optimal screen position and distance; whether to use a plain text editor or a large, complex development environment; chair placement; the best music to code to; the best headphones; whether headphone amplifiers actually enhance listening; whether open-plan offices are better than individual or shared offices; the best bug-tracking software; the best programming methodology; the right way to indent code and the proper placement of semicolons; or, of course, which language is better. And whatever you do, never, ever ask a developer about productivity software.

        Meanwhile, the executives who run large programming teams have to actually ship software. “Ship” is a cult word. If they don’t ship on time, managers could get a lower rating on their performance reviews and end up making only inordinate, as opposed to obscene, amounts of money. Wine cellars are at risk, not to mention alimony payments. As managers, their job—along with all the trust falls and consensus-building and active listening—is to reduce ship risk, which comes in many forms: bad bugs; features that were promised to bosses or clients that distract from boring, utterly necessary features; or test servers that crash at night. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One of the greatest ship risks is anything shiny. This is where languages are particularly risky. An experienced and talented programmer can learn a language in a week, but a middling one is going to take much longer. Meanwhile, exciting, interesting programming languages always come with a list of benisons, promises of speed or productivity or just happiness. No, really. Happiness is a serious selling point for languages, and people have written blog posts where they analyze how people discuss code. According to an <a href="https://github.com/Dobiasd/programming-language-subreddits-and-their-choice-of-words">analysis by GitHub user Tobias Hermann</a>, PHP coders are far more likely to use the word “hate” in their Reddit comments than Clojure programmers; Clojure programmers are far more likely to use the word “cool” than PHP programmers.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many blog posts on how to persuade your manager to switch to a new language. Experienced managers, who bear scars and were often coders themselves, become practiced at squinting and coughing and saying things like, “No, the switching cost is just too high right now,” or, “Maybe we could do a two-week trial project when we build the analytics reporting engine.”<a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light2').style.display='block';">17</a>
        <div id="light2" class="white_content">
            It’s a balance. You also don’t want to create a situation where engineers can’t play around, because then they’ll set up systems behind your back “just for testing.” That’s how Linux spread.</a>. <br>

    </p>
    <p>
        Then the programmers shuffle back to their standing desks and complain until the product is shipped. Or else they just quit, because Lord knows there are jobs out there. For programmers, particularly the young ones, there are jobs everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
        Managers and old coders have fewer options. It’s often better to just keep working and shipping, even if the code starts to look ugly, even if there are nominally better solutions, even as the technical debt <a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light3').style.display='block';">18</a>
        <div id="light3" class="white_content">
            Technical debt is the idea that software often launches without everything buttoned up, to meet deadlines or because some features were prioritized over others, and over time, as systems change and evolve, a kind of code-debt builds up. It’s no different from infrastructure debt. Bridges, tunnels, or tech—to do new things in a compatible way can require painful, wasted effort. Sometimes, to move a system forward, you need to address that debt: Upgrade the balky server, deal with the fact that your user account manager tends to log people out without warning, or occasionally throw away a component and start again.</a>. <br>

            <p>accrues around you, because in a few years everything will change. Maybe you’ll get promoted and the new manager will have the will and motive to tear up everything you did, cursing, and start again (perhaps using a new language) with the goal of making something much simpler. Or the entire industry will spasm and everything you’ve done will need to be thrown away and rebuilt along new lines anyway. (From desktop to Web, from Web to mobile, from mobile to … quantum? Who knows. But there’s always something.)</p>
            
    </p>
    <p>
        Somehow it keeps working out. The industry is always promising to eat itself, to come up with a paradigm so perfect that we can all stop wasting our time and enter a world of pure digital thought. It never happens.

        4.4 Why Are There So Many Languages?
    </h2>
    <p>
        One of the famous papers in computing, “The Next 700 Programming Languages,” by P.J. Landin, talks about the 1,700 languages already cluttering up the computing landscape. It was written for an academic journal and has a wonderfully accurate, koan-like opening statement: “Most programming languages are partly a way of expressing things in terms of other things and partly a basic set of given things.” It was published in 1966.
    </p>
    <p>
        A few of those 1,700 languages are still with us. <a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light4').style.display='block';">19</a>
        <div id="light4" class="white_content">
            You know what, though? Cobol has a great data-description language. If you spend a lot of time formatting dates and currency, and so forth, it’s got you. (If you’re curious, search for “Cobol Picture clause.”)</a>. <br>
            <p></p>

            <p>Cobol, for example, a legendary and much-hated, extremely verbose language that was intimately linked to the “year 2000” problem. As computer scientist Dijkstra once described it, “The use of Cobol cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offence.”</p>
    </p>
    <p>
        While no one sings its praises (except for banks—banks love Cobol), it still runs on mainframes. Fortran, for Formula Translating System, by John Backus, and LISP, for List Processor, by John McCarthy (eventually it was lowercased to Lisp, just as UNIX became Unix), were both developed in the 1950s, in the days of <em>Desk Set</em>-style computers fed by huge tapes or paper cards, and both are still in use today. The power granted by Fortran was inherent in its name—it looks almost comically computerish:
    </p>
    <pre>
        <code class="fortran">    
        PROGRAM SQUARES
        CALL SQUARE(10)
        END
        SUBROUTINE SQUARE(N)
        SUM = 1
        DO 10 I = 1, N
        WRITE (*,'(I10,$)') (I*I)
    10  CONTINUE
        PRINT *, ""
        END</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
        That’s the same program that we wrote in C, page 50, the one that ever-so-usefully prints a list of squares. You can pick up the weird metallic smell of large computer centers with raised floors just by looking at some Fortran. <a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light5').style.display='block';">20</a>

            Different computing eras smelled differently. The old, huge machines had a slight burning-metal smell. Early PCs gave off different odors of plastic, metal, and enamel. And who could forget the wafting scent of a monitor with smoke pouring out the back? The goat-like aroma of dozens of people in a computer center, up against a deadline? The odd smell of laser toner or massive piles of pulpy striped paper? Occasionally I’ll see a picture of a pile of old machines from the 1980s, and the olfactory memory will jump me.</a> <br>

        Lisp, though, is another kind of beast. It emerged straight out of mathematical research. There are many things that made Lisp peculiar.

            Lisp is a language that programmers venerate because of its rich history and its simplicity—and the fact that such simplicity makes it possible for Lisp to program itself; it’s described as a “programmable programming language.” If you ever have bright programmers who need a challenge, send them off to learn Lisp. Some may return as insufferable evangelists, but more likely they will come back smarter and more flexible.</a> <br>

        Back in the 1980s, while the Fortran programmers were off optimizing nuclear weapon yields, Lisp programmers were trying to get a robot to pick up a teddy bear or write a sonnet. But one day, the people who ran the funding parts of the world came in, yelled, “Shut it all down,” and pulled a big red switch (which was probably programmed in Fortran). The Lisp programmers, who had yet to simulate a human brain or automatically produce a great sonnet, were left with only regret. <a href = "javascript:void(0)" onclick = "document.getElementById('light7').style.display='block';">22</a>

        There’s still quite a bit of Lisp in the world, such as in the air-travel data system built by ITA, which was acquired by Google.

There was a time when Lisp looked to be deader than ancient Greek: a beautiful philosophical system, but not practical.
